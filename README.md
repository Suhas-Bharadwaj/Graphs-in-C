# Graphs-in-C
This is supposed to be a full implementation of graphs in C using adjacency matrices.
The makeEdge function either does not work or the printGraph function does not but either way fixing that will complete the program. 
The numbers in main are what I chose at random to test the code, feel free to change it to suit your need.
